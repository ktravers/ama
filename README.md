# ktravers/ama

A repository to ask [@ktravers](https://github.com/ktravers) anything.

Forked from [@holman's ama repo](https://github.com/holman/ama) and inspired by other awesome AMA repos like [`nrrrdcore/feedback`](https://github.com/nrrrdcore/feedback) and [`notwaldorf/ama`](https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama).

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/ktravers/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer as soon as I can. Once I answer, I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further questions, just respond in the thread, and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue, too, even if you didn't create it.

Note: If you have any technical problems with GitHub, you're better off [asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/support), since you'll end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/ktravers/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
